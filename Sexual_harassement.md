## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

As a bystander or witness to harassment, I can play an essential role in supporting
the person targeted by harassment. The following tools can be used when I witness
harassment in a variety of settings, including sexual harassment in the workplace:


* Direct: If you feel that directly addressing harassment is safe and may be effective,
you can confront the harasser and call out the behavior at the moment. Let them
know you find their behavior inappropriate, intimidating or hostile, and ask them to
stop. This approach may escalate the situation, so consider whether you and the
person being harassed are safe and whether you believe the person being harassed
wants someone to speak up.<br>

* Distract: You can stop an incident by simply interrupting it. Rather than focusing on
the aggressor or action, this subtler intervention allows you to engage the person
being targeted through a distraction – ask a question, start an unrelated
conversation, physically interrupt the incident, or find a reason to call the person out
of that space.<br>

* Delegate: Find an appropriate third party to intervene, such as a supervisor, human
resources officer, security officer, or another colleague.<br>

* Delay: If am not able or choose not to intervene at the moment, you can still
support the person who has been harassed by following up with them afterward.<br>

I can offer acknowledgment and empathy and can ask whether they need
additional support, resources, or documentation of the incident. I can also
confront the harasser later and let them know that you found their behavior
inappropriate.<br>

* Document: Depending on the circumstances and whether other interventions are
more urgent, it may be most helpful to document what I am witnessing. If can can record an incident or jot down details, be sure to follow up with the targeted
individual and ask them what they would like done with the documentation; do not
share it without their consent.<br>

* Report the harassment.
People who experience harassment and bystanders who witness it have the right to
report it. Remember that the individual who experiences harassment should ultimately
decide whether they want the incident to be reported, and they may have valid reasons
for not wanting to take action – such as fear of retaliation.<br>

* Promote equity and respect in your workplace, and be an ally to someone being
harassed.
