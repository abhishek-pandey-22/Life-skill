### What is the Feynman Technique?
The main concept behind <b>Feynman Technique</b>  is to try to explain it simply.
Like in general life by attempting to explain a concept in simple terms, Anyone can quickly see where you have a good understanding of that concept. You’ll also be able to instantly pinpoint your problem areas, because they’ll be the areas where you either get stuck or where you end up resorting to using complex language and terminology.
The ability to relay complex ideas to others in simple, intuitive ways – the <b>Feynman Technique</b> is a method for learning or reviewing a concept quickly by explaining it in plain, simple language.

Best way to make understand anyone your thought is to made it simple or in addition to helping peoples to pinpoint those problem areas in the concept you’re trying to learn, the Feynman Technique gives you a quick, efficient way to shore up those areas using targeted learning. It’s a simple technique, but it’ll help you study much more efficiently once you put into action.

### Differeent way to implement this technique in your learning process?

##### Some steps are following which needs to get followed for better outcome

<b>Step 1:</b> Grab a sheet of paper and write the name of the concept at the top. You can use pretty much any concept or idea – even though the technique is named after Feynman, it’s not limited solely to math and science.
<br><b>Step 2:</b> Explain the concept in your own words as if you were teaching it to someone else. Focus on using plain, simple language. Don’t limit your explanation to a simple definition or a broad overview; challenge yourself to work through an example or two as well to ensure you can put the concept into action.
<br><b>Step 3:</b> Review your explanation and identify the areas where you didn’t know something or where you feel your explanation is shaky. Once you’ve pinpointed them, go back to the source material, your notes, or any examples you can find in order to shore up your understanding.
<br><b>Step 4:</b> If there are any areas in your explanation where you’ve used lots of technical terms or complex language, challenge yourself to re-write these sections in simpler terms. Make sure your explanation could be understood by someone without the knowledge base you believe you already have.

### Learning How to Learn TED talk by Barbara Oakley

In video Barbara Oakley, PhD, PE is a professor of engineering at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan described about How can you change your brain, Keys to learning effectively , How to create a focus mode, She also talk about Procastination slow thinking etc.

### Steps that you can take to improve your learning process?

 - Vary your learning routine, locations and material
Many students have a fixed time and place to study. However research has shown that varying your study location – at home in a different room, at school, in a library- can improve learning. In a similar way occasionally changing the time of day you study and the materials you use - laptop, pen and paper, speaking into a voice recorder - also boost learning. 

#### - Space your study time<br>
It's better to do two one-hour study sessions than a single unbroken two-hour session. You will remember more if you do an hour today, then another hour tomorrow, especially if you get the right sleep during the night (see tip 2).

"Cramming" for an exam can work…. for your exam results
This is a last resort tactic and is proven to work short term, so you will probably do better in the exam. But you won't remember much long term.

Your brain makes long-term memories only after some forgetting has happened. This is similar to a muscle that needs exercise to break it down a little so that it can become stronger.

#### - Use self testing<br>
This is a strong, proven learning technique. You can test yourself by trying to remember what you were learning, or explaining it aloud to yourself or to someone who is prepared to listen. You can get friends to quiz you. One of the benefits is that is that you can get immediate feedback whether you are right or wrong.

#### - Don't worry about short breaks or distractions while you're studying<br>
Learning scientists know that a short break while you are trying to solve a problem you're stuck on is one of the best ways to succeed. When you take a break, your brain will continue to work on the problem subconsciously, without the imposition of preconceived ideas you may have had.

#### - Create learning sessions where you mix knowledge areas or skills<br>
When you focus on learning one thing at a time, it is the fastest way to acquire the learning but it can put a limit on the extent of the learning.

#### - Mixing the knowledge areas in a learning session –<br>
For example working on maths, then history, then building a PowerPoint presentation about astronomy in a single learning session will sharpen your grasp on all of them better than if you used the session for one knowledge area alone.

#### - Increase your brain’s capacity to learn<br>
The first eight tips are really about how to get the best result from your brain’s current "learning capacity”. By “learning capacity” I mean the  physical structure of your brain, including all the neural networks that determine how well you can think (your memory, attention, speed of processing and ability to sequence ideas). Imagine if you could increase your brain’s ability to do those things better. Thanks to recent neuroscience research and the conversion of that into a range of brain training programs we all now have the ability to improve our learning capacity. Then when you use the learning tips 1 – 8, you will get an even better learning outcome.

#### How to learn anything:<br>
The main way to start learning new skill in particular time is to be consitent and satart enjoying it with doing some steps to folow.
<br>1.Deconstruct the skill(what do you want  to be capable after learning the skill, divide the skills into smaller pieces of skill).
<br>2.Learn enough self correct.(get three or five resources about the skill (books, course, online resources) )
<br>3.Remove practice  barrier (internet, social media ,television)
<br>4.Practice at least 20 hours. (You can overcome the frustration barrier after practicing the 20 hours)
##### In my point of view the major barrier is not intellectual , its emotional*
