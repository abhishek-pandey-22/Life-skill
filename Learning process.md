### What is the Feynman Technique?
The main concept behind <b>Feynman Technique</b>  is to try to explain it simply.
Like in general life by attempting to explain a concept in simple terms, Anyone can quickly see where you have a good understanding of that concept. You’ll also be able to instantly pinpoint your problem areas, because they’ll be the areas where you either get stuck or where you end up resorting to using complex language and terminology.
The ability to relay complex ideas to others in simple, intuitive ways – the <b>Feynman Technique</b> is a method for learning or reviewing a concept quickly by explaining it in plain, simple language.

Best way to make understand anyone your thought is to made it simple or in addition to helping peoples to pinpoint those problem areas in the concept you’re trying to learn, the Feynman Technique gives you a quick, efficient way to shore up those areas using targeted learning. It’s a simple technique, but it’ll help you study much more efficiently once you put into action.

### Differeent way to implement this technique in your learning process?

##### Some steps are following which needs to get followed for better outcome

<b>Step 1:</b> Grab a sheet of paper and write the name of the concept at the top. You can use pretty much any concept or idea – even though the technique is named after Feynman, it’s not limited solely to math and science.
<br><b>Step 2:</b> Explain the concept in your own words as if you were teaching it to someone else. Focus on using plain, simple language. Don’t limit your explanation to a simple definition or a broad overview; challenge yourself to work through an example or two as well to ensure you can put the concept into action.
<br><b>Step 3:</b> Review your explanation and identify the areas where you didn’t know something or where you feel your explanation is shaky. Once you’ve pinpointed them, go back to the source material, your notes, or any examples you can find in order to shore up your understanding.
<br><b>Step 4:</b> If there are any areas in your explanation where you’ve used lots of technical terms or complex language, challenge yourself to re-write these sections in simpler terms. Make sure your explanation could be understood by someone without the knowledge base you believe you already have.
